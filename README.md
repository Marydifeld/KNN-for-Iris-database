# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
Overview
This is a simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. Currently, it works with the Iris dataset and uses the Euclidean distance to classify flowers into their respective species. 

## Features
- Uses the Iris dataset: One of the most classic datasets in machine learning.
- Euclidean distance: For calculating the distance between data points.
- Adjustable k-value: You can change the number of neighbors (k) to see how it affects the classification results.
## How It Works
The algorithm looks at the k-nearest data points in the dataset and uses the majority vote of their classes to predict the class of a new data point. It's a simple and intuitive way to classify data without any complex math or deep learning.
